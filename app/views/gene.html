      <p>BRAF, an intracellular kinase and component of the cell growth MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)
        signaling pathway, is mutated in a diverse range of human cancers, including melanoma and lung cancer.</p>
      <p>The BRAF protein is a serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation
        of the
        mitogen-activated
        protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (PMID: 15520807), which under physiologic conditions regulates the expression of
        genes involved in cellular functions, including proliferation (PMID: 24202393). Genetic alterations in BRAF are
        found primarily in melanomas and thyroid cancers as well as a small fraction of lung and colorectal cancers. The
        most common BRAF point mutation is V600E, which deregulates the protein's kinase activity leading to
        constitutive
        BRAF activation and signaling as a monomer (PMID: 20179705), although other mutations have been found (PMID:
        12068308) which affect the protein's propensity to dimerize (PMID: 16858395, 26343582). The product of these
        alterations is a BRAF kinase that can activate MAPK signaling in an unregulated manner and, in some instances,
        is
        directly responsible for cancer growth (PMID: 15520807).</p>
